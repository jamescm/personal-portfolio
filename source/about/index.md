# About
Hello, my name is Cory James and I like to state the obvious! I'm a computer scientist, programmer, and web developer. I love to learn and try new things. I went to college at Baker College for my Bachelor of Computer Science and graduated summa cum laude. I've had the opportunity to work in a variety of different environments and positions.

I am very fond of computer science and software engineering. I have a usual tech stack that I fall back on for production applications but I am constantly learning. JavaScript, Node.js, Docker, MySQL are usual technologies for me but requirements often demand a change from the norm. I'm quite familiar with Python, Ruby, Java, C#, C++, and several other languages. I'm also known to use Elixir and Haskell on my personal projects. I also use a lot of Git but much of my work tends to be sensitive so it's challenging to release code in public areas.

I love fitness and nutrition! Good health is important to everyone alive if they want to keep it that way. I love to learn more about healthy ways of eating and living. As a developer, I also recognize the dilemma posed by having a job that often requires me to sit at a desk for hours at a time.
