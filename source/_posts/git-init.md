Hello! My name is Cory James and I like to make web applications. Many of my projects will be hosted here. Take a moment to see [examples of my work](/personal-portfolio/projects).

I will also create tutorials and guides for languages, libraries, and various technologies. I *really* like to learn new things so expect a wide array of information in different domains of computer science. My usual technology stack consists of JavaScript & Node.js, Docker, front-end technologies (HTML(5), CSS, SASS, etc.), and databases (Mongo & MySQL). I love functional programming so expect discussion about the paradigm as I learn more about it.

If you want to learn more about me, check out my [about](/personal-portfolio/about).
